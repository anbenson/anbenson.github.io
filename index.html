          <p>Hello! I'm Andrew, a native of Seattle currently living in the
          California Bay Area. I am a software engineer as well as a computer
          science student. I aim to design systems that are secure,
          maintainable, and easily understood, and I'm interested in studying
          how we can make that easy to do, through languages and frameworks and
          through CS education.</p>
          <p>I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2017 with a BS in
          Computer Science. I spent two years in industry before returning to
          school to pursue my interests in CS education. Currently, I am a
          second-year MS student studying computer science at Stanford
          University.</p>
          <p>In the Winter 2021 quarter, I am instructing CS 107A, the ACE
          section for CS 107. Previously I was a CA for CS 107 and CS 110. At
          Carnegie Mellon, I was a TA for a variety of courses, including
          15-251, 15-151, 15-131, 15-122, and 15-112.</p>
          <p>I work at Google as a senior software engineer developing the
          front-end of the Google homepage and searchbox. (Before you ask, no, I
          don't know why you see such weird suggestions, and no, I don't really
          do much machine learning in my work.) In the past, I interned at
          Facebook, Microsoft, and a small SF-based startup.</p>
          <p>Opinions are my own and don't represent my employer or whatever. In
          that vein: Spaces are better than tabs. Vim is better than emacs.
          Firefox is just as good as Chrome, and is better for the web ecosystem
          (I acknowledge that my colleagues working on Chrome are talented and
          well-intentioned). Linux is great, but isn't for everybody, and that's
          okay.</p>
          <p>If you wish to contact me, my Stanford username is <span
            class="email">adbenson</span>, and I'm confident you can put
          together the email address from there. Or if you know me in real life,
          you can use those channels too.</p>
