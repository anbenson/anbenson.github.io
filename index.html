          <p>Hello! I'm Andrew, a native of Seattle currently living in the
          San Francisco Bay Area. I am a software engineer as well as a computer
          science student. I aim to design systems that are secure,
          maintainable, and easily understood, and I'm interested in studying
          how we can make that easy to do, both through languages and tooling
          and through CS education.</p>

          <p>I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2017 with a BS in
          Computer Science. I spent two years in the software industry before
          returning to school to pursue my interests in CS education. Currently,
          I am a third-year MS student studying computer science at Stanford
          University.</p>

          <p>In the Fall 2021 quarter at Stanford, I am teaching
          <a href="https://cs9.stanford.edu">CS 9</a>, a course on navigating
          the tech recruiting process, and
          <a href="https://cs107a.stanford.edu">CS 107A</a>, the ACE section for
          CS 107. In previous quarters, I've taught CS 107A and CAed for
          <a href="https://cs107.stanford.edu">CS 107</a> and
          <a href="https://cs110.stanford.edu">CS 110</a>. At Carnegie Mellon, I
          was a TA for a variety of courses including theoretical computer
          science (15-251), discrete mathematics (15-151), practical UNIX
          (15-131), data structures and C programming (15-122), and intro
          programming (15-112).</p>

          <p>I work at Google as a senior software engineer developing the
          front-end of the Google homepage and searchbox. (Before you ask, those
          weird suggestions you see come from real people, and no, I don't
          really do much machine learning in my work.) In the past, I interned
          at Facebook, Microsoft, and a small SF-based startup.</p>

          <p>Opinions are my own and don't represent my employer or anyone else.
          In that vein: Spaces are better than tabs. Vim is better than emacs.
          Firefox is just as good as Chrome, and is better for the web ecosystem
          (although my colleagues working on Chrome are talented and
          well-intentioned). Linux is great, but isn't for everybody, and that's
          okay.</p>

          <p>If you want to contact me, my Stanford username is <span
            class="email">adbenson</span>, and I'm confident you can put
          together the email address from there. Or if you know me in real life,
          you can use those channels too.</p>
